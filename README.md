# ML_Practice

A repository containing the notebooks of some ML related projects I am working on

## 1. [Recommendation/](/Recommendation/)

This repository contains a Recommender System built on the concepts of collaborative filtering. The system can be used to provide personalized recommendations based on user ratings and preferences.

## 2. [Topic Modeling and Document Clustering](/nlp/topic_modeling_and_document_clustering.ipynb)

This notebook focuses on document clustering and topic modeling, aiming to analyze, categorize large sets of text data and extract latent topics. It includes techniques for dimensionality reduction, clustering, evaluating the quality of clusters, and uses bertopic for topic modeling and representations.

## 3. [Rock Paper Scissors Player](https://github.com/The-Professor99/rock-paper-scissors-project)

An algorithm designed to play a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) using traditional statistical analysis and sequence modeling.

## 4. [Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Gm8rj6VTBbcSKPZzB2LFGHo3VnfeK0Uj?usp=sharing)

A deep learning model trained to predict healthcare costs.

## 5. [Cat and Dog Image Classifier](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JBmMUJukeqTt5X4zLyEod9g75LYaZ-wm?usp=sharing)

A deep learning model trained to classify images of dogs and cats.

## 6. [Neural Network SMS Text Classifier](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10AOuGvD-M8-ROxuKrLXQAnVPXNyY-Bs9?usp=sharing)

A neural network model trained to predict if an email is spam or ham

## 7. [Dialogue Summarizer](/nlp/transformers/Dialogue_Summarization.ipynb)

This notebook demonstrates the fine-tuning of a transformer model(google/pegasus-cnn_dailymail) on the SAMSum dataset to summarize chat dialogues. The process involves data preprocessing, training the model on conversational data, and evaluating the summarization results using metrics such as ROUGE. Note that this was done for practice purposes, so the fine-tuning process was not fully optimized for production use.
